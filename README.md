### Experience space travelling right from your computer

This is an experimental project to explore webGL technology using [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) library

## Challenges Faced
* Using a library without a bundler & CDN
* Structuring JS code to run in `<script>` tag

## Solutions To Challenges
* Download *min.js* file to use the library
* Write code in terms of *fuctions* rather than *class*

## Learnings
* Creating `scene`, `camera`  & `rendering` it onto a canvas
* Using `textureLoader`, `Geometry`, `Points` & `PointsMaterial` to create stars
* Transforming goemetries
